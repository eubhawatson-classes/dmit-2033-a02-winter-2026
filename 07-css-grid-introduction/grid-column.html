            <h2>Happy Little Layout</h2>

            <div class="col">
                <p>We'll blend it all together. Let's make this a little more interesting. Just sorta twist in a little sky. Quickly drop in just a little warm part of the sky here. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas.</p>
                <p>Everybody needs to sing in the sunshine! Let me put a little on the other side too, we don't want it to feel left out. If we make a boo-boo, it's right here -- but that's alright, because we don't make mistakes in our world. He lives right there -- that's his home. Just work it around and around and all the way out to the edges.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col">
                <p>Create that little fuzzy look. You just sort of have to make almighty decisions. Such a temptation to do a little bit more. Don't overwork -- be lazy! Tongue got over my teeth there and I couldn't see what I was saying.</p>
                <p>Really be stingy with it. You know me -- I like water. Think about form and shape -- how do you want this thing to be? You can take your time and put in all the little fantastic details that you want to back here. Every series, we need to have a crazy day.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col">
                <p>You have to sort of plan these clouds. I'm always looking for a nice, easy way to do this. When I finally got to Alaska, whew boy, I just went crazy Wherever you think they should be, then that's exactly where they should be. Ready to go!</p>
                <p>Now we can start picking out some individual things. You can always add more if you want it. Don't be afraid of this big brush. We'll just sort of see what happens. The round brush is so fun, let's go back to that.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Special Image Column -->
            <div class="col col-img">
                <img src="img/penguins.avif" alt="A group of King Penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) standing together in their natural habitat.">

            <div class="col">
                <p>Brush mix! We're gonna play some games here with different planes. I want some happy little things happening up here in the sky. We can stir this up a little bit. Pull from the outside in.</p>
                <p>A place for all the little creatures to put their money. Don't be afraid of it. This is a very individual thing, painting is. If you're gonna do mountains, it's fun to have little bumps on them here and there. It'll open whole new worlds for you once you learn to make friends with this knife.</p>
